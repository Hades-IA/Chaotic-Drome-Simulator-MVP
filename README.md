# Chaotic-Drome-Simulator-MVP
 One simulator of Chaotic deck builder Drome. All nostalgia of animation in a simple interface! 

-How to add my cards?
there are two paths:
1- overwrite existing cards. you just need to rename your image (600 x 300) to slidenumber.png.
Example: in Chaotic-Drome-Simulator-MVP \ img, you named your card slide0.png and replace Chaor.
0 of 3 are the underworlds,4 of 7 are the Mipedian, 8 of 11 are the overworlds  and 12 of 15 are the danians.
